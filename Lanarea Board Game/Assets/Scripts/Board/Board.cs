 * There will be a board manager to manage the different boards
 * and connect them together
 * The hexagonal boards will be built in a flower shape
 * Each board will consist of tiles - nodes
 * and the vertices will be paths that can be blocked
 * or have effects when passed through
 * How best to code this?
 * 
 * Each tile will be of a type of terrain
